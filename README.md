# VHS Movie Collection API constructor with Form!

Full stack application using React with hooks and React-Bootstrap Form on front-end, and Node.js, Express, and Mongoose on the backend to collect form data of VHS movie releases to build database in Mongo DB Atlas. 

I have an embrassingly impressive collection of movies on VHS tape and I have plans to implement the data into a fun website using the data collected through my form. 

Under ongoing construction.
