# VHS Movie Collection API constructor with Form!

Full stack application using React with hooks and React-Bootstrap Form on front-end, and Node.js, Express, and Mongoose on the backend to collect form data of VHS movie releases to build database in Mongo DB Atlas. Front end currently deployed on Netflify, back end on Heroku.

I have an embrassingly impressive collection of movies on VHS tape and I have plans to implement the data into a fun website using the data collected through my form. 

Under ongoing construction.

[Front end Deployed via Netlify!](https://vhs-api.netlify.app/)
